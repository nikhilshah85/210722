						React is a result of Web Revolution

	a. What is a web revolution ?

		-- When was the first time u used internet ? - 2007 is the global average
		-- Why did u use internet in those days - view results, projects, emails, downloads, surfing
		-- where did u use internet in those days - Cyber cafe / Home
		-- Source of internet ? - Broadband / telephone lines
		-- Which devise u used ? Desktop - laptop(rare)


	Thus developers used to create web contents for the above requirements
		This used to be a server centeric applications - thus we had server centeric frameworks for developmnet
======================================================================================================================

				Today, this has revoluationised 

		-- Why did u use internet in those days - for everything and anything
		-- Where do u use internet ?            - everywhere
		-- Source of internet ? Wifi - MobileData
		-- Which devise u used - Mobiles phones / Tablets / laptops
		-- Habbits - camera, navigation, location shareing, 
			tilt the phone, zoom in zoom out with fingues
			login, useing facebook, insta, twitter
			Thus Developer needs to develop application accordingly 
				users are on Mobile network (is always flucuating)


	Thus we need to develop differnet type of application all together
		We need a client centeric framework - React, Angular, backbone came in
						Do everthing on client devise - Reduce the roundrips between devise and server

			Thus a web pattern for client end development came out - Component based development

			React fraework by Facebook - for UI development
			1. Everything is a component 
			2. Client devise (including mobile phone) understands only 3 things
						HTML, CSS, JS
		
			3. HTML is now upgraged to HTML5 (this takes care of lots of change in new era)
			4. CSS is now CSS3 - great changes
			5. JS (not object oriented) has been upgraded now to OOPS - ES6 
				ES6-7 is not easy to use program (very very difficult to programm)
				Thus microsoft made it easy - calls it as Typescript (similar to C# and Java)
				
			Combination of (HTML5, CSS3 and ES) forms a component
			Component is a plug-in

		Eg. An website / APP has 6 pages
			Home
			About
			Contact
			News
			Careers
			Login

			you need to have minimum 6 components


	----------------------------------------------------------------------------
		set up and installtion

		1. NodeJS will act as a server, which will host ur application and u would be able to browse the app on browser
			NodeJS is by google
			https://nodejs.org/en/ (16.16)
		2. NPM - Node package manager - download packages for development
			(this gets installed with Node)
		3. npm view react version
		
		4. VS Code
